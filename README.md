## Objectives

1. **Perform data cleaning and transformation**: Ensure the dataset is accurate and ready for analysis by resolving data inconsistencies and adjusting the form of data, creating additional columns if needed.
2. **Data calculations**: Create DAX measures in Power BI to calculate and display various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
3. **Visualize data**: Build interactive Power BI dashboards to uncover key correlations and enable stakeholders to explore the data dynamically.
4. **Analyze results**: Carefully analyze all charts and other visualizations to draw conclusions and detect any previously unnoticed data inconsistencies.
5. **Generate Business Insights**: Provide actionable insights to aid decision-making, including outlet performance, sales trends, and product visibility.
